# LittleLemon

This project is a simple and elegant web page designed for booking a table at Little Lemon, a cozy restaurant offering fine cuisine. The page includes a responsive reservation form where users can enter their name, email, phone number, date, time, and number of guests to make a booking. It also features a gallery section showcasing images that reflect the restaurantâ€™s ambiance and dining experience. The design uses HTML5 for structure, CSS for styling (linked via `style.css`), and incorporates the Google Fonts `Inter` family for modern typography. The gallery images are sourced from Unsplash to provide a visual appeal. The form submission is set to POST data to the `/book` endpoint, which would require backend handling to process reservations. To use the project, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. This project was created by Zi'Aire Tirado and can be customized further by adjusting the form action or styles as needed.
